Can some course instructor talk more about the Discover the problem statement ?

### 🗨️ Post by `CKPIITM` on `2021-12-28T08:26:03.025Z`

From the graded assignment we can’t understand what is right way to think unless we make trial and error. can we have some practice assignment to understand our thinking process is properly aligned or not. With just GA it would be difficult to assess.

Apart from what [@CKPIITM](/u/ckpiitm) observed about this course, here’s my first impression of this course…Granted, it has been only a week, but I think I must go ahead anyway…

The week-1 clearly shows a lack of planning, from the program as well as the specific course perspective. It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard. The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point. What’s the context and the motivation? Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text. Can’t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker. Neither does give me much understanding anyway. It was filled with terminology that I’m yet to pick up. The speaker didn’t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren’t…In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.

Summary. I feel the course is offered too early. Rather, I took it a little too early.  
Definitely, I can’t relate to most things the speaker is talking about. At least, I don’t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program. I’m sure it does, but now, I don’t know how.

Sorry, I’d never been as critical about anything as this one. I just had to. I’m willing to hear different opinions.

I’m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.

I am totally clue less about the expectation of instructor from the participants of this course. And the question of graded assignment was something, I found myself out of context. I know I can pass any course but I don’t just wanna pass without any concrete learning. The real problem this time is not TIME.

Hopefully courses instructor will guide us through this conundrum.

### 🗨️ Post by `fml` on `2021-12-29T09:22:55.203Z`

I feel like we need an introduction video of some kind for this. Or it should have been suggested only to those who have completed all the ML courses. From the offset, there are people who don’t know what modelling is, the different kinds of models etc. but there is no explanation for all this. Granted, it was mentioned in the orientation that it would only be tools with no explanation.

But I am hopeful that this will get better in the later weeks as this is the only “comprehension” type of week (reminiscent of the english courses lol). The other weeks will all involve practical approach and coding. As long as adequate time is spent on introducing each new thing, I think it should be okay.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `Anand` on `2021-12-29T09:26:54.026Z`

As of now, I’m set on my mind to drop the course, unless something hopeful turns up next week. Will continue after all other ML courses are done…

### 🗨️ Post by `Neelotpala` on `2021-12-29T09:36:43.765Z`

Some sort of introduction would have been better instead of just diving into the topic. Nevertheless, I hope we get practice questions/assignment to comprehend the concepts.  
In the meantime if anyone gets some sort of resources to practice elsewhere, do share.

Adding to the discussion here, I’d also have to say it’s quite the same feeling for me. I got lost while going through the videos. At first, I thought it’s some issue with me, because of which, the video is making less meaning. Seems like, many have the same issues. As told by many here, I would also emphasize the need for more practice questions.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `CKPIITM` on `2021-12-29T11:23:22.206Z`

Participants of this course should express their experience so that a more meaningful content can be created and provided to us as supplementary. From lec video it is clear that the recording were made around july so they had around half an year time to work on it.

The other problem is, there is no visible resource to get our hands on experience.

### 🗨️ Post by `aaysha007` on `2021-12-29T11:59:18.445Z`

I also feel the same. but I think with further weeks the course will become more interesting.

### 🗨️ Post by `NoOne` on `2021-12-29T13:26:14.320Z`

As my peers said i also feels the same way but i don’t have thought of dropping course rather i wanted some more content to add from IITM side to make the students more comfortable in this journey.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `Anand` on `2021-12-29T14:32:59.028Z`

well, my choice of dropping might be wrong…but, guided by the following factors.

  * The recording was perhaps done much earlier as [@CKPIITM](/u/ckpiitm) pointed out in his reply, and so chances are most of it would’ve been already recorded. So, lesser chances to re-record them.

  * There are no live sessions planned yet for this course… the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it’s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.

  * Finally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.

### 🗨️ Post by `CKPIITM` on `2021-12-29T14:35:50.271Z`

Imagine if your reason doesn’t get resolved even after all ML courses are over then in that case you will underutilize your time. So I would suggest don’t think of dropping, it is just a course and we just need to pass it and leverage this knowledge to search for better resources and learning material.

wasn’t it you who wrote this earlier

### 🗨️ Post by `CKPIITM` on `2021-12-29T14:42:08.807Z`

But this will not lead me to dropping either. I always find ways to learn. I start with expectation and then start my own search for knowledge.

### 🗨️ Post by `akruti` on `2021-12-29T15:01:25.762Z`

I certainly differ from the point of view of the conversation going on in this thread.  
In my opinion, I am thinking this first week of content as to understand how the problems or objective come from a company which needs these models to implemented. It is more of a professional view rather than a student view. We need to first understand the problem and then start the solution rather than just jumping on to modelling each question.

### 🗨️ Post by `anand095` on `2021-12-29T19:10:20.130Z`

I also found 1st week content engaging and practical. Maybe I will get few questions wrong,but I feel the concept of discovering the problem was well introduced.

I too find content of week 1 engaging and practical. I agree with [@anand095](/u/anand095) and [@akruti](/u/akruti).

Interesting! Just this morning, during my morning walk I was thinking how each of us is different in our outlook, our potential, how we realize it, how we’re challenged…and the recent posts show that we indeed are different! It’s important that none of us stay put on what works for us and what we think is right, but be willing to see the other point of view too…

I think I’m starting to understand the other points of view…well I’m trying to

The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
I have similar concern  
For Q1, I used the following code:
    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
    kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    

And got the following output:
    
    
    Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04
    

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.  


[![A multiple-choice question with options for 'Mileage: 0.95', 'AvgDistance: -0.05' (selected), 'Mileage: 0.21', and 'Engine Capacity: 0.17'.]image281×219 9.1 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fa9a2e601c94da84cbd25c406235d1009b204c.png "image")

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
    
    
    print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
    pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
    for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
        pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
        print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')
    

and got the following answers:
    
    
    Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
    	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
    	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
    	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08
    

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).

Dear TDS Team,

There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

  1. Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
  2. In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
  3. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.



The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.

Thank you for your support.

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.

For instance:

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

My question 7 for GA6 is :  
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance  
Whose options provided are :  
10418 meters

12287 meters

10965 meters

11149 meters

However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)

I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)  
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

**“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”**  
So I did.

###  _Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments_

Yes, I got **great marks** in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.  
But let’s be real…

It was **my Labrador** who did the actual work 

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

  * Solving **deployment issues** faster than my dev server boots
  * Writing **function calling code** like a true GPT whisperer
  * Fixing **LLM bugs** that I didn’t even understand



Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.  
He growled at broken APIs.  
I took the credit.

###  Message from the Dog Developer:

>  But I am **personally offended** by one thing…”

[@Carlton](/u/carlton) With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion.

I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns?

Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?

---

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-04-07T05:53:37.081Z`

I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session.

I submitted the project **within the deadline** , and I ensured that **all requirements were fulfilled** , including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: [GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.

Hi [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)

Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

[@24ds2000125](/u/24ds2000125) [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.

Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.

These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.

Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.

We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.

I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.

Kindest regards

Sir,  
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).  
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.  
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.  
Thankyou!

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-04-02T15:55:00.653Z`

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

Hi Guddu ,

I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?

command that I used :  
`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`

here --root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.

While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log-0 as the most recent one? or the log-<largest_number> file? Please clarify.

The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  
Deliverables,  
and _an example_ of the Evaluation has been provided.  
If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  


[![The image shows instructions for deliverables and notes. Deliverables include creating a GitHub repository, adding an MIT license, writing and testing code with POST and GET requests, committing and pushing code, creating a Dockerfile, publishing the Docker image to Docker Hub, and ensuring the image runs via podman. It also includes submitting the GitHub and Docker image URLs in a Google Form. The notes advise using the AIPROXY_TOKEN environment variable, using the AI Proxy token with a $1 limit, sticking to GPT-4o-Mini, and keeping prompts short and concise, with each /run and /read call completing within 20 seconds.]Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4.png "Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am")

Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.

So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.

Regards,

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

I am unable to open the files shared by the students I am peer reviewing as I don’t have access to them on my student email. Since we were asked to give access to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in when submitting, I wanted to check how this will work—will the team provide us access, or do we need to request it from the student and wait for them to grant it?"

# Clarification on API Endpoint Correction in Submission

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
I submitted the form before the deadline with the API endpoint as /api, but I later realized the correct format was /api/ (with a trailing slash). To fix this, I edited the Google Form today.

Will this cause any issues with the submission? Please let me know if any further action is needed.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `21f2000709` on `2025-04-02T11:52:04.861Z`

It is not like that, it can be any endpoint, but whatever you submit should work. Like many frameworks treat /api/ and /api differently.

The project 2 docs assumes that the endpoint is /api/ and provides the code accordingly.

### 🗨️ Post by `23f2005702` on `2025-04-02T12:04:08.373Z`

you are right but if I use postman with /api end point it wont work but with /api/ it will work so..

# GA7: Peer Grading Clarification

**Topic ID:** 171515

### 🗨️ Post by `22f2000644` on `2025-04-01T13:11:54.500Z`

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Hello everyone,

I have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with actual questions from the GA’s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of ‘test cases’ so that we can try and fix our project?

Thank you very much in advance

You can do a curl post request or use something like Thunderclient or Postman. If you used fastapi then in the /docs path of your link you will find the open API user interface which you can also use for testing.

# Scores and End Semester exam

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I have two queries.

  1. Could you provide an ETA of GA6 score, GA7 score, final Project 1 score and Project 2 score?

  2. I am uncertain about being able to attend the End Semester exam. In case I choose to take the end semester exam next term, will the project scores and ROE score be carried forward to the next term? I don’t know if the marking scheme will change next term or if the old marking scheme is followed for such cases.




Please let me know if possible.

# Request for Extension on TDS Project 2 Deadline

**Topic ID:** 171428

### 🗨️ Post by `raji_13` on `2025-03-31T09:36:18.418Z`

I am really facing difficulty completing Project 2 on time as we had our OPPE exam yesterday, and the past week was dedicated to preparing for it. Additionally, due to an unforeseen emergency, I was unable to write the ROE exam, which resulted in lost marks. This makes it even more crucial for me to perform well in this project to make up for it.

I sincerely request if it would be possible to extend the deadline by 2 days. This would allow me to put in my best effort and submit quality work. I truly value this opportunity and would be extremely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

A little more time will help us deploy properly as well. [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) please allow for some more time. Even when working in groups and mixing and matching code… the real messy work is debugging and deployment due to the sheer variety of it. Some are deploying on AWS, some on scalingo, some on Digitalocean, some on Render, some on Azure… even helping amongst ourselves is getting complex because of this.

I would like to share that we have successfully completed **TDS Project 2** , solving **46/57** cases dynamically via **Azure after deployment**! We also tested it with our friends’ **GA questions** , and it’s working as expected.

This project was a **team effort** by me and two friends [ [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) and [@23f2004637](/u/23f2004637) ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.

I would love the opportunity to **demonstrate our project** to **TA and Anand Sir** in a **Google Meet session** on **March 31st** (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).

If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.

# Concerns Regarding Various Issues: Graded Assignments, Project Doubts, and ROE Score Updates

**Topic ID:** 170147

---

### 🗨️ Post by `lakshaygarg654` on `2025-03-17T05:32:43.063Z`

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Dear TDS Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.

### 1\. Graded Assignments (GA)

  * **GA6 Doubts Unresolved:** While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. [(Thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283)

  * **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to _Seek_ and in GA7, to _Google Forms_. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.




### 2\. Project Updates

  * **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.
  * **Project 2:** There are multiple doubts posted in the _Project 2_ discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? [(thread link)](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/29)



### 3\. ROE Score Update

  * While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.



I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Lakshay

[@carlton](/u/carlton) It’s been over a month, and now an extra day has been taken as well—when will TDS Project 1 finally be released? The delay is getting excessive; some clarity on the timeline would be appreciated.

> **GA Platform Changes:** Initially, we were solving questions on [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev) . However, in GA6, we moved to _Seek_ and in GA7, to _Google Forms_. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.

The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.

With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.

GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.

lakshaygarg654:

> **Project 1:** The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.

Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.

Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.

You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

Thank you for your response [@carlton](/u/carlton) and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.

The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.

We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.

Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.  
Looking forward to your response.

# Problem with TDS GA Scores

**Topic ID:** 170131

### 🗨️ Post by `22f3001561` on `2025-03-16T18:46:29.863Z`

In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)

Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0

I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there

I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?

[@22f3001561](/u/22f3001561) GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).  
All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.

We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.

As I understand, the criteria for passing are:

  1. Achieving a score greater than 40 marks in the graded assignments.
  2. Securing more than 40 marks in the end-term examination.



Could you kindly confirm if this understanding is accurate? Additionally, please let me know if there are any other prerequisites to be met.

I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”

I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?

# What's the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?

This thread is **not** about:  
_\- request to change grading pattern_  
_\- request to change ROE formula_  
_\- request to grant free marks_  
_\- to crib/cry for anything related to marks_

Here I wish to ask about:  
**Q.1:** what is that learning, which this course want us to prove through ROE exam?  
**Q.2:** Is it possible to answer 17 questions fairly without fluking within 30 minutes using formal methods? (just by solving them properly)  
**Q.3:** What is the knowledge, using which I can solve all 17 questions within 30 minutes (without fluking & without socializing/chatting/asking (with) others)?

I feel, my Q3 is little bit combination of Q2 & Q1, still I am looking forward for all 3 answers separately. Please help me to understand the real essence of this ROE quiz.

Thanks in anticipation,

### 🗨️ Post by `s.anand` on `2023-08-30T05:00:30.302Z`

[@ankit.jain](/u/ankit.jain) – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.

**What does this RoE evaluate?** Implicit learning.

  * Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?”
  * Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”



Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds.

Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time.

Some, they just CAN’T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their skill set is different.

The RoE evaluates how much of learning is implicit. (Projects test how much is explicit.)

**Can you answer 17 Q in 30 m?** Hopefully not.

I hope this is at the edge of the class’ competence. If multiple people answer all 17, I’ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.

(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I’ve come to value frank feedback over polite encouragement.)

**What knowledge helps solve it this fast?** Practice.

3 strategies help.

  1. **Consistent practice**. Practice regularly. Pick problems just outside the edge of competence (fail 50% of the time).
  2. **Social learning**. Observe experts & peers and internalize their strategies. We’re social animals and learn faster through mimicry.
  3. **Emotional engagement**. If we like it or enjoy it, we learn faster. Practicing on real-world problems or problems we enjoy solving, working with people we enjoy, helps.



**Is it worth it?** Maybe not.

Not all implicit learning is worth it.

  1. You may not need it. 10 years ago, as a data scientist, scraping was worth learning implicitly. Today, as a manager, I’d just hire someone to do it.
  2. You may not be good at it. When I got a “D” in German, followed by a “D” in Japanese, I realized I’m just not mentally wired for human languages. It’d be too much effort to learn.



The RoE scores will give an idea of your implicit learning.

But your time is limited. Implicit learning is costly. Please focus your time judiciously.

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:

![Image description unavailable.] [exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.
    
    
    inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
    textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
    buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
    inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
    

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

  1. The chaos of ROE.
  2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
  3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
  4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
  5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
  6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
  7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
  8. How limited the time is.



The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab
    
    
    df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]
    

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing) [](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

### [df_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as
    
    
    margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100
    

using this i got answer for 1st question as
    
    
    YEAR                              1992
    AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
    WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
    WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
    WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
    RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
    RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
    RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
    MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114
    

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments

### Why? 

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM 

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

  * If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
  * If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful

Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zones—Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3).

I wanted to let you know that I was unable to attend the ROE session today. I’ve been running a high fever since yesterday, and while I managed to complete my JAVA OPPE this morning, I started feeling much worse afterward. I felt it was necessary to get checked out by a doctor and unfortunately had to miss ROE as a result.

I was wondering if there might be any possibility of taking the ROE at a later time? Please let me know if there’s anything I can do or if any arrangements can be made.

# Is it fair to consider 20% weightage of such exam which is impossible to solve in given time (i.e. ROE)

### 🗨️ Post by `23ds1000034` on `2024-07-29T02:42:05.733Z`

Hello Sir, [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

As TDS is one of the most important courses in the data science diploma, I respectfully want to bring up a concern. The TDS roe exam is almost impossible to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a statement by your side…

My question is, why is this exam graded and carrying 20% weightage towards the final grade? Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this exam ungraded or reduce its weightage. This is a very serious issue, as many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

Thank you for your consideration.

I completely understand and share the concerns about the time constraints of the TDS exam. Given the challenging nature of the test, it seems quite difficult to complete all the questions within the allotted 45 minutes.

I believe even the course team would find it challenging to solve this exam in such a short time frame.

> Perhaps considering a percentile-based grading system could be a fairer approach, as it would better reflect the relative performance of all students.

This way, we can ensure that the grading is equitable and does not unfairly impact our CGPAs. I hope the team can consider this suggestion.

[@23ds1000034](/u/23ds1000034) [@nandanreddyp](/u/nandanreddyp)

TDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly penalises you.

> This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly.

While that seems like a nice sound bite, let’s look at the data as true data scientists rather than let emotion lead our thoughts.

If you get an S in TDS, its weight to your total Diploma CGPA will be 5.55%.  
When you consider that ROE is worth 20% of that, the overall effect on your diploma CGPA at BEST is 1.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect **is lower** if you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!

> This is a very serious issue

A little over dramatic a statement considering the data we now have considered above. The reality is the ROE is worth 0.83% of your overall diploma CGPA (and that too this is the worst case, i.e. for direct diploma students! For those that started from foundation its impact **is even smaller! 0.52%)**

What is my opinion on ROE? It made me a better student. I was truly humbled by the experience. It gave me a realistic view of my abilities and the level I need to attain so that I can be confident in the value I am adding to the client. Who is the client? The businesses I might deal with, the companies I contract for.

If there was no value attached to the ROE (i.e. you have no stake in it) then all the evidence points to one very simple truth. Nearly no one taking it seriously.

> many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.

My mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree. If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant for you.

ROE is not harsh. ROE is like my mother’s very wise advice. There are many, many examples of students dropping out of university and being successful in life. **Do not waste your time,** its more valuable than anything you possess. If you are struggling, to even maintain a 6 CGPA requirement to enter the degree level because of an ROE that contributes > 0.834%, then the very best advice you will ever receive from me is: Do not waste your time with this degree.

I say this with all sincerity and truth. I am living evidence, as are many others, you do not need this degree to succeed in life. The reason I am doing this degree is because I realised that I actually enjoy this course and I find real value from it and hope to make a difference for good with what I learn from it.

Although it is called the impossible exam, our data shows that there are several students that have done well in the ROE. ROE is not harsh. It’s a reality check, its a mother’s advice and a very inexpensive, truthful and effective one.

Humbly for your kind consideration

Since ROE is done and whatever everyone has scored cannot be changed. Well, we can make up for the marks that we lost by having few more extra activities, if that’s possible [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir. That way we get back what we lost, improve CGPA (irrespective of whatever CGPA one has) and learn in the process that would be a win-win situation for everyone.

### 🗨️ Post by `iitmanupam` on `2024-07-29T10:19:12.231Z`

[@carlton](/u/carlton), we are mixing something straightforward as the ability to score an S or A grade in TDS with a philosophical outlook on the topic.

The philosophy is helpful if the grades for most students are following a standard bell curve (average of all subjects or average of TDS over the last few semensters) and a few students are outliers in terms of the grading. For e.g., if I score a lower than expected grade and I am feeling demotivated, I can understand what you just wrote and it is indeed very much to the point.

However, if the entire grading bell curve has shifted and most students are not scoring grades as per expectation, it is time for the instructors to consider whether the grading pattern needs to be tweaked (20% for an “impossible” ROE is perhaps on the higher side) or students need to be provided with alternate paths to a decent grade (like extra assignments for 10-20 marks in lieu of the loss of marks above mentioned ROE).

I would like to reiterate that my observations above are only w.r.t. a standard grading bell curve for all subjects or for TDS from previous terms.

Do note that all IITs follow normalization of marks and grades as a standard activity so that students can focus on learning and giving it their best rather than worrying about grades. This is not the case in this course, so we should think about alternative grading patterns without compromising on the rigour of the course in any way.

iitmanupam:

There’s a lot of philosophy in there but that’s what makes it so entertaining to read his writing 

iitmanupam:

> if the entire grading bell curve has shifted

Disagree with this if you mean the bell curve has shifted between terms. RoE has been really tough since the past 3 terms at least (I haven’t checked with students who did it before that, so I don’t know about those). Or if the issue is a bell curve mismatch between different subjects, we shouldn’t be expecting that to be perfect. Some of the subjects were extremely easy, but nobody complained about those 

For what it’s worth, I also felt it was tough beyond reason. These sort of exams where the time required far exceeds the time given is more typical of competitive exams where the score isn’t important, only your rank is. All that being said, I still didn’t complain since the difficulty is “real”, and not made-up like with BDM theory/project. With the first, the difficulty comes from an extremely poor grading system, and with the second, from having to find a business that will share data. The subjects themselves don’t pose a significant intellectual challenge.

Also, is an S at TDS really hard this term? I scored one last term despite a poor RoE performance. I’m unable to recall now whether they gave us some extra marks out of pity 

PS: There is no implication from any of my remarks that I will stop sharing RoE jokes/memes

Come on. I didn’t complain. I just gave my observations. In fact, the only time I really complained in this course was when I was suddenly left hanging because the ROE stopped 15 minutes before the time shown in the portal. That was then. After seeing the difficulty level of the repeat ROE from yesterday, I’ve decided that I’m one of the lucky ones who was able to attempt the ROE last Sunday, regardless of the mess up from the support team.

I’ve also said many times on Discourse that I think this is one of the best courses at IITM and nothing about it should be changed. I don’t know how you got an S in spite of a poor ROE. For me, I will have to score a perfect 100% in the ET to get an S, so I was just being realisitic when I requested for additional assignments to give students a fighting chance to score an S.

Sorry, didn’t mean to say that you’re complaining. Meant literally that I didn’t complain despite the unusual difficulty level though this sort of thing is usually a cause for concern.

Maybe we got some extra marks last term then, I’m not sure. (A student with better memory than me can chime in)

# Concerns Regarding TDS Course Difficulty and Grading Fairness

**Topic ID:** 168476

---

### 🗨️ Post by `A_LAKSHMI` on `2025-02-25T17:21:11.919Z`

Dear [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Anand](/u/anand) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi)

First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the **TDS team** in supporting us throughout this course. The **live sessions and guidance** have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.

However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.

## **Key Challenges Faced**

###  **Lack of Prerequisites**

This course did not list any **prerequisites** , leading many students—including those from **non-technical backgrounds** —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the **course content, assignments, and projects** have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.

###  **Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure**

The **difficulty of the projects** has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to **rely heavily on peer support** just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.

###  **Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback**

Many students joined **TDS** based on past **Discourse posts and feedback** , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for **working professionals** and students without prior experience.

###  **Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)**

While we have put in significant effort—spending **2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)** to secure good scores—we still find ourselves **struggling to meet expectations** for the **projects and RoE** , which are significantly harder than anticipated.

We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.

We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.

Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.

Right,

I tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.

I completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.

### 🗨️ Post by `22f2001640` on `2025-02-25T17:49:47.969Z`

Hi [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@Bharathi](/u/bharathi) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Could you please look into the above issue?

Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:

### **Grading Concerns**

**Final Course Score:**  
T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F  
(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:  
[What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838).  
Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.

Furthermore, for Project 1 (**deadline: 16th Feb 2025**), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.

### **Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues**

  * Many students pursuing this course are **dual-degree students or working professionals** , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.
  * The **last-minute guidance** for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.
  * The **structuring and scheduling of sessions** feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.



### **Request for Improvement**

To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:

  1. **Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2** , well in advance of the deadline.
  2. **More structured and accessible support** , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.
  3. **Better management of exam difficulty levels** , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.



I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.

Thank you [@A_LAKSHMI](/u/a_lakshmi) for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.

Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the **grading pattern will not be changed**. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.

  1. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this [Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/84) where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the [first page of the TDS course](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/) GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:



> **This course is quite hard**
> 
> Here’s students’ feedback:
> 
>   * It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024. [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681) [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)
>   * Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.

> 

> 
> **[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you’re ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.

  2. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - _Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help_  
Again to quote Anand:



> **We encourage learning by sharing**
> 
> You _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).
> 
> **Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.
> 
> **To learn well, understand** what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.
> 
> **To learn better, teach** what you’ve learnt.

  3. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).  
Once again Anand has a [nice blog](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/should-courses-be-hard-or-easy/) where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.
  4. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.
  5. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - _Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them_ The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.
  6. [@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.

Regarding your point of the short term benefits of grades vs the long term benefits of learning, I think I’m speaking for a lot of my peers that we’re not concerned about grades at this point, we just at least want to pass this course.

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course.

While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.

I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass.

I understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.

Could you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.

Thanks and Regards  
Shalini

Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…

It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.

ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.

Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.  
The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.  
_The problem is the lack of time._

So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.

Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.

Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.

The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.  
But we will help you be as ready as possible for it.

Kind regards

hi [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
how are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-25T10:58:33.712Z`

You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.  
I will also add the same in the student seek portal.  
Mock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!  
The gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the TDS team.

Kind regards

3 questions:-

  * will the questions and dataset be available after time limit?
  * will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?
  * will the live solving video lecture be recorded?

They will be available after the live session has finished.

23f1002382:

> will the solutions be available for later reference with the questions?

We will provide an answer script for Mock ROE1

23f1002382:

Yes our live sessions will be recorded.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) , I will not be able to solve the mock in the given time due to other commitments. The grading document says 2 marks bonus for mocks. Will this be a part of that? If yes, is there any other way? As you have mentioned, I will keep a timer and try to solve it in 45 minutes.

yes in live session ROE was solved but while taking reference for Q1 from live session from TAs to see how this question might be solved as i was getting wrong answer, but TA also didnt solved that question in correct manner he got wrong, I think we should have at least 1 standard ref for all the questions of this mock roe to understand our mistakes in solving this questions pls understand thanks,  
also when i went throught live session recording i can see only 1 screen of 1 ta

Hi [@shubhamatkal](/u/shubhamatkal) ,

For question1 provided answer is wrong.  
Regarding yesterday’s ROE we will send out ipynb with snippets of code that’s requried to solve questions.

For Today’s ROE you will be able to check answers immediately

For Thrusday’s ROE as well there will be some mechanism for checking answers.

Kind regards.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Sir please shift the ROE date to another date because we really need time to understand all these stuffs as these are so hard for beginners like us and there is quiz 2 and we have to prepare for that also.  
Sir please understand our situation and pay attention to our concern.

I feel for you because you constantly get incorrectly tagged. On the plus side you are famous (or infamous depending on perspective )

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-26T02:47:44.061Z`

Just FYI the correct tag to use for Professor Anand of TDS is [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Also ROE date will not be moved because its an exam date that has been set before the term starts. This is just part of the policy of the BS Programme. Exam dates never get moved except in truly exceptional circumstances.

Kind regards

It seems that the question in _Graded Assignment 5 for TDS_ is producing incorrect results despite the same logic working correctly for other variations of the problem. Please check into this question once as I have cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this issue in this question. Thanks!

# Request for a functionality to revise the GAs of TDS

**Topic ID:** 168310

### 🗨️ Post by `22f3002813` on `2025-02-24T10:45:52.414Z`

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
Dear team,  
Greetings of the day

I am writing this to request for a functionality

  1. Practice the GAs again after their deadline has passed
  2. Either the answers can be posted or the same question answering and simultaneous evaluation interface can work just like it does before the deadline.



How this is beneficial?

  1. As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time
  2. Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term



Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

Looking forward to your guidance and kind consideration  
Regards  
Aryan

# Project 2 and Week 6 assignment

**Topic ID:** 168303

### 🗨️ Post by `Yogesh1` on `2025-02-24T08:43:31.200Z`

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

Release of Project 2 has been delayed by 3 days, and release of Assignment 6 has been delayed by 10 days.

Could you please clarify if the submission dates will be changed accordingly? I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.

Please let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-24T08:55:51.942Z`

[@Yogesh](/u/yogesh) GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions.

We do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet.

Kind regards

---

### 🗨️ Post by `Yogesh1` on `2025-02-24T09:01:02.321Z`

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-24T09:16:21.851Z`

Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.  
Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.

We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.

The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.

We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.

Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.

Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.  
Kind regards

# ROE instructions request

**Topic ID:** 168142

### 🗨️ Post by `23f2000573` on `2025-02-22T12:34:59.729Z`

Hi TDS team, with ROE being ahead, i assume an official thread will be created soon. Here are few doubts from my side. I request the official post to cover these.

  1. Syllabus
  2. kindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice
  3. I did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time
  4. Any mock or resource to practice from?
  5. additional tips, if any

---

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-22T13:09:52.956Z`

1. Modules 1 - 5
  2. Questions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules.
  3. ROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame.
  4. We will have some past ROEs as practise
  5. … watch sessions



Kind regards

---

### 🗨️ Post by `22f3002248` on `2025-02-22T14:58:22.135Z`

Thanks for the answer [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?  
P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `Rishabh2` on `2025-02-23T05:33:31.105Z`

Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??

---

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-24T07:40:15.196Z`

ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.

Kind regards

---

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-24T07:52:35.373Z`

The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).

If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” 

So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.

There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.

Kind regards

### 🗨️ Post by `Yogesh1` on `2025-02-24T08:39:53.315Z`

Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?

---

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-24T08:59:27.794Z`

Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens.

Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.

Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

---

### 🗨️ Post by `s.anand` on `2025-02-04T06:15:20.501Z`

[@JoelJeffrey](/u/joeljeffrey) It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.

I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.

Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.

Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?

The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like

  * Is the GitHub repo public?
  * Does it have an MIT license?
  * Does it have a DockerFile?
  * Is the Docker image accessible?

Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

!["No such repo;No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile. Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring."]  
Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.  
I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.

Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.

Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.

Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.

Dear TDS Team,

I have verified my submission, and my repository **does include a Dockerfile** , and the **Docker image is accessible on DockerHub**. Please find the attached screenshot as proof. Kindly review my submission again and let me know if any further action is needed.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Good Morning Sir,  
Sir even I am facing a similar issue, even though sanity check for docker image on docker hub was cleared but got a mail saying ‘dockerfile’ not present in the GitHub repo while it clearly was. Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project.

Looking forward to your reply.

So the reason for the failure is:

You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM)

Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.

Then once you realised your mistake, on **Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST** i.e _yesteday_ , you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.

Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”]  


[![The image shows a file directory with the following files and folders: .., LLM_PROJECT1, __pycache__, Dockerfile, LICENSE, app.py, datagen.py, evaluate.py, requirements.txt, tasksA.py, tasksB.py.]image250×534 3.92 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/a/6a4a28aa638840e8d2e4dbf246ca235fd41e5ccb.png "image")

  
[/quote]

showing that your files are in the correct place.

We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir  
Yes, I corrected my repo at 9:11 PM IST, but I had actually written and submitted my query much earlier at 4 PM. At that time, I wasn’t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.

I understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn’t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I’d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) and [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir

It is becoming quite evident that a lot of us will struggle to get something decent out for the project-1 by saturday and we are struggling here. I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.

Thanks

and others…

I have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:

  * We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.
  * All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)
  * Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)
  * We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.



All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:

**Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed.**

Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.

Kind regards  
TDS Team

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.  
Please sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.  
Please sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -

  * Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course **not as a full-time** student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.

  * Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.

  * Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.




Thank you.

Hi Sakshi,

The error is quite clear, it cannot find the file /data/contacts.json

Question: What creates the /data/contacts.json file?

Sakshi as the error says it’s unable to find your file. Try adding a . (dot) before the location.

---

### 🗨️ Post by `Sakshi6479` on `2025-02-14T14:32:12.846Z`

sir i have used the dot(.) while sending the request to postman in the query which i provided to the task. Is the dot(.) should be added somewhere else?

---

### 🗨️ Post by `Saransh_Saini` on `2025-02-14T15:07:26.713Z`

If you have added that dot as a prefix to your locations then, you would have to structure your query_gpt in such a way that it takes these dots into consideration.

have you first post a request for task A1 as it creates the data folder along with all the other files .

no actually do we have to create another file for that or we have to request post in this one ? can you guide me for that step wise . it would be very helpful.

by running task A1 , it automatically creates a data folder along with all the files in it. Without running task A1 you can’t do rest of A tasks

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-14T05:12:27.093Z`

Currently we do not have any explicit policy regarding requiring IITM email as the github profile name or the github repo owner.

We DO however require you to use your IITM email when submitting the project submission form.

We are clarifying with operations at the moment if this arrangement satisfies their requirements. If it changes we will make a general announcement via email, portal and discourse.

(we do not expect the current requirements of github to change)

# Sudo permission needed to create data folder in root?

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-14T04:53:36.939Z`

Hi Vikram,

This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py  
Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile  
which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.

So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):

  1. You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000
  2. You create a docker image that runs this application server.
  3. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.
  4. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:  
evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.
  5. Run evalute.py using uv.



If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.

Hope that gives clarity.

Kind regards

I have facing lots of difficulties in assignments and it was taking alot of time to solve a single assignment, so please extend the deadline for project 1 as it contains more weightage and it required more time to solve it.  
Please kindly consider my request, as I am from non-technical background it is taking most of the time of a week because of which other Courses are suffering.

# Chat GPT new release

Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited 

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important - the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

Therefore wanted to learn and regardless of the scoring I still wish to complete GA1 but, I see that I can’t access the questions anymore …

Is there any way to give the answers in the portal and check. I just want to learn and test my knowledge

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`

So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

[@Nelson](/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

### 🗨️ Post by `s.anand` on `2025-01-14T12:52:41.809Z`

[@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) in that case

  * a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
  * a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080



Please try one of these:

  * Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
  * GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) suggested



You _could_ try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.

The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .

### 🗨️ Post by `carlton` on `2025-02-06T05:49:08.446Z`

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

[ ![The image is a title slide with "Week 3 Session 1" in large white text over a background featuring various icons representing data analysis, charts, and connectivity, with a dark blue semi-transparent overlay.] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmSMQ5LWa30&t=3133)

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

[ ![A screenshot of a desktop screen showing a Google Meet call and an open browser window with Naruto as the background and several website shortcuts. The Google Meet call shows a user named Amit Kumar Gupta. The browser window has shortcuts to various websites including a Discourse page, a project document, data science tools, Java tutorials, and programming resources.] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OdReZsvi2w)

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

[ ![A screenshot of an IIT Madras online course on data sourcing, detailing the course content, resources, and a live scraping session example. Carlton D'Silva is visible on the right side of the screen.] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELZf0n_0u9w)

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards

I missed a week’s worth of learning, and I’d like to catch up by attempting the assignments after going through the video tutorials. I’m not asking for grades as deadline is passed, just the opportunity to complete them for the sake of learning. I would really appreciate if this can be made possible.

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

# Best Practices for Virtual Environments and Dependency Management in Python

**Topic ID:** 165922

---

### 🗨️ Post by `24f2006531` on `2025-01-31T06:26:47.630Z`

Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.

Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?

That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.

Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:

  1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.

  2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.

  3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.




* * *

  1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**



• Good for quick experimentation and testing.

• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.

  2. **Using requirements.txt**



• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.

**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**

• If you **don’t specify a version** , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.

• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)** , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.

**Handling Version Conflicts**

• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.

• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:

• Using **greater than/less than constraints** : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).

• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.

**Best Practices Summary**

  * Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
  * Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.
  * Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
  * Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.



Kind regards

For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.

> For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement

* * *

24f2006531:

> Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?

Coming to your second question,

The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt.

* * *

24f2006531:

> My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation

The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.

> Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt `. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you

Thank you sir for clarifying.

I wasn’t aware of greater than/less than constraint. This would definitely address the error I mentioned in my question.

# Issues In TDS And Replacement with another course

**Topic ID:** 164147

### 🗨️ Post by `Rrishit` on `2025-01-18T07:57:16.857Z`

The knowledge required by students to do TDS has been revised during recent terms. ( Mentioned that as per industrial standards/ needs).

Additional programming skills are required(in addition to Python) to follow the TDS Course. That means indirectly, one should complete many courses diploma in programming before doing TDS.

In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.

# Need Clarity

**Topic ID:** 164205

### 🗨️ Post by `psisaddicted` on `2025-01-18T16:13:12.288Z`

I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.

Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.

I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.

PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.

**Topic ID:** 163241

### 🗨️ Post by `23f1002382` on `2025-01-14T11:33:23.361Z`

I recently explored the details of the extra credit project and found the problem statement and its clever framing both fascinating and challenging. While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time.

I want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect. If there are any recommended readings, practice problems, or areas of focus that you believe would provide a solid foundation for approaching this project, I would be very grateful for your suggestions.

Thank you for considering my request. I’m genuinely excited by the challenge and hope to make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow under your guidance.

Can anyone forward the specified links of the books(iitm certified(logo)) or pdf’s for preparation?

[@Divya1](/u/divya1) there are no IITM certified books nor PDFs for [Tools in Data Science](/c/courses/tds-kb/34). The site <https://tds.s-anand.net/> is the reference.

We update the content regularly. You might want to [track the changes](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commits/tds-2025-01/) for recent updates.

# Can I take the end-term exam without submitting assignments if I missed it due to an emergency?

**Topic ID:** 161072

### 🗨️ Post by `24ds3000064` on `2025-01-01T16:20:54.915Z`

I missed the end-term exam due to an urgent emergency.

The grading assignment indicates I’m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?

Can I still take the end-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

Yes you dont have to submit your assignments but just give the End term. Just check if you have got the I grade

### 🗨️ Post by `24ds3000064` on `2025-01-13T16:11:47.948Z`

Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course,

I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify

# Way of conduction of exam

**Topic ID:** 163144

### 🗨️ Post by `Divya1` on `2025-01-13T15:35:53.326Z`

My doubt is that “Will there be any coding level questions in the ROE and the weekly graded assignments?”

---

### 🗨️ Post by `ADI_1792` on `2025-01-13T15:48:49.846Z`

In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course .

For example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .

Same goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.

### 🗨️ Post by `22f3001914` on `2025-01-06T20:00:14.908Z`

Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom). This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)** , our course instructor, and TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)** , whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

  * Expand functionality and evaluation models.
  * Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
  * Improve documentation for broader accessibility.



The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process - <https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared>  
Best regards,  
Avinash Shrivastava

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards
